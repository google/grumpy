# NOTE(compatibility): This method uses Go's filepath.Join() method which
# implicitly normalizes the resulting path (pruning extra /, .., etc.) The usual
# CPython behavior is to leave all the cruft. This deviation is reasonable
# because a) result paths will point to the same files and b) one cannot assume
# much about the results of join anyway since it's platform dependent.
